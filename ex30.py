# # Exercise 30

# In this exercise, the task is to write a function that picks a random word from a list of words from the SOWPODS dictionary. 
# Download this file and save it in the same directory as your Python code. 
# This file is Peter Norvigâ€™s compilation of the dictionary of words used in professional Scrabble tournaments. Each line in the file contains a single word.

        while line:
            line = f.readline().strip()
            lines.append(line)
    return lines[random.randint(0, len(lines) - 1)]
