# # Exercise 26

# Your task this week: given a 3 by 3 list of lists that represents a Tic Tac Toe game board, tell me whether anyone has won, and tell me which player won, if any. 
# A Tic Tac Toe win is 3 in a row - either in a row, a column, or a diagonal. 
# Donâ€™t worry about the case where TWO people have won - assume that in every board there will only be one winner.
