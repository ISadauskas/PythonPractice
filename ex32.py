# # Exercise 32

# In Part 1, we loaded a random word list and picked a word from it. In Part 2, we wrote the logic for guessing the letter and displaying that information to the user. 
# In this exercise, we have to put it all together and add logic for handling guesses.

# Copy your code from Parts 1 and 2 into a new file as a starting point. Now add the following features:

# Only let the user guess 6 times, and tell the user how many guesses they have left.
# Keep track of the letters the user guessed. If the user guesses a letter they already guessed, donâ€™t penalize them - let them guess again.
# Optional additions:

# When the player wins or loses, let them start a new game.
# Rather than telling the user "You have 4 incorrect guesses left", display some picture art for the Hangman. This is challenging - do the other parts of the exercise first!
